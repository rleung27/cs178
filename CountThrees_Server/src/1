# Name makefile
# Course: CS178 Build Automation for DevOps and QA
# CRN: 76718
# Date: 9/18/2017
# Assignment: Write a makefile that contains the following two targets:
#     ServerCountThrees - a native executable file that counts the number of 32 bit 
#         ints with the value 3s in the binary file threesData.bin
#     runServerCountThrees - a target that launches the executable
# usage: make
# Reference: https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/howto/makefiles.txt

run: runServerCountThrees clean

ROOT = "../"
src_build_dir := $(shell mkdir -p $(ROOT/src/build))

# ServerCountThrees is the target
# which depends on ServerCountThrees.o readInt32BitLE.h readInt32BitLE.c existing
ServerCountThrees: ServerCountThrees.o readInt32BitLE.o
        # Linking command for linking two object cod files together
        # into a target executable called ServerCountThrees 
	cc -o $@/ServerCountThrees ServerCountThrees.o readInt32BitLE.o

# Create the readInt32BitLE.o target by compiling readInt32BitLE.c
readInt32BitLE.o: readInt32BitLE.c readInt32BitLE.h
	cc -c readInt32BitLE.c

# How to build the target ServerCountThrees.o
# depends on ServerCountThrees.c and readInt32BitLE.o existing
# if any 2 file changes, then ServerCountThrees.o must be rebuilt
ServerCountThrees.o: ServerCountThrees.c readInt32BitLE.o
	cc -c ServerCountThrees.c

# Create the runServerCountThrees target
# runServerCountThrees will launch the ServerCountThrees executable
runServerCountThrees: ServerCountThrees
	./ServerCountThrees	

.PHONY: run

# clean up
clean:
	rm *.o ServerCountThrees
